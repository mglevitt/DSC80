    "The flights dataset for 2015 is not small (~600MB). While you could likely load the entire dataset into Pandas on your laptop, if you wanted to work with more than one year, this would quickly become difficult (the data is available for 1987-2018). Therefore, we will filter down the dataset into two smaller files without ever reading the larger dataset fully into memory. We are going to create two smaller datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. All flights arriving or departing from San Diego International Airport in 2015.\n",
    "    - You can find a list of all the airport codes in the United States [here](https://www.leonardsguide.com/us-airport-codes.shtml).\n",
    "2. All flights flown by either JetBlue or Southwest Airline in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you are going to use the `chunksize=N` keyword in Pandas `read_csv` to read the flights dataset in blocks of `N` lines. When you use this keyword argument, `pd.read_csv(fp, chunksize=N)` becomes a *iterator* that iterates through dataframes of length N until you have reached the end of the dataset. A typical pattern looks like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "L = pd.read_csv(filepath, chunksize=1000)\n",
    "for df in L:\n",
    "    process(df)\n",

    "\n",
    "The processing you are going to do is:\n",
    "1. Iterate through the dataset, chunk-by-chunk,\n",
    "2. Filtering out rows of each chunk\n",
    "3. Incrementally add to a filtered csv file (since the data is perhaps too big to keep in memory). Keep in mind, if you want to keep writing to the same file, the mode='a' keyword in the `.to_csv` method can be helpful when calling it in the loop (a stands for 'append')\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Write two functions that create the datasets below, using the 'chunking' pattern described above. Your functions should use `chunksize` of 10000.\n",
    "1. `get_san` which takes in a filepath containing all flights and a filepath where filtered dataset #1 is written. The function should return `None`.\n",
    "1. `get_jb_sw` which takes in a filepath containing all flights and a filepath where filtered dataset #2 is written. The function should return `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 1*: **Gradescope autograding servers are quite small and can't load this dataset into memory** -- so your code that reads in the large `flights.csv` dataset *must* work with chunks of the dataset one at a time to pass!\n",

    "**Question 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "Often `DEPARTURE_DELAY` is thought to be the main cause of a flight delay -- i.e., when the flight is late pushing off from the gate. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are other ways that flights can be late: waiting on the tarmac, headwinds, turbulence, circling a busy airport, and waiting for a gate after landing. First, we will analyze all the ways in which a flight can be delayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, create a function `depart_arrive_stats` that takes in a dataframe like `flights` and calculates the following quantities in a series, indexed by `late1`, `late2`, `late3`:\n",
    "    - `late1`: the proportion of flights from/to SAN that leave late, but arrive early or on-time.\n",
    "    - `late2`: the proportion of flights from/to SAN that leave early, or on-time, but arrive late.\n",
    "    - `late3`: the proportion of flights from/to SAN that both left late and arrived late.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Second, create a function `depart_arrive_stats_by_month` that takes in a dataframe like `flights` and calculates the quantities above broken down by *month*. That is, the output is a dataframe, indexed by `MONTH`, with columns given by `late1`, `late2`, `late3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 1:* Does this question reveal any data quality issues? Can you pinpoint when these issues occur?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 2:* A flight is considered late if it departed/arrived any time later than its planned departure/arrival time.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 3:* You do not need to manually calculate the delay time for those delays that are `NaN`."

    "This question is for fun and explores a very data-science type problem: can we automate finding examples of Simpson's Paradox? This is an active area of research (see for example: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04385.pdf), but is a very accessible problem. While totally optional, this question can lead to pretty interesting self-driven projects!\n",

    "**Question 10 (Searching for Simpson's Paradox):**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you observed from the reading in the lecture notes, Simpson's Paradox often occurs due to some confounding factor among the columns of a dataset. In the case of gender balance in student admissions to academic departments at UC Berkeley, the confounding factor was the admission rate (i.e. how hard it is to gain admission to a department).\n",
    "\n",
    "What might be a confounding factor be for flight delays among airports in question 8? Now you are going to write code to discover instances of Simpson's Paradox; that is, you will programmatically find interesting relationships present in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the dataset `jb_sw`, we'd like to find new groups of airports, as in question 8, for which the statistics of flight delays between JetBlue and Southwest satisfy Simpson's Paradox.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function `search_simpsons` that takes in the `jb_sw` dataset and a number `N`, and returns a list of `N` airports for which the proportion of flight delays between JetBlue and Southwest satisfies Simpson's Paradox.\n",
    "- Only consider airports that have '3 letter codes',\n",
    "- Only consider airports that have at least one JetBlue *and* Southwest flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 1:* Iterate through groups of airports of size `N` using `itertools.combinations` until you find a group that works. Make sure your function finishes, even if it doesn't find something.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Remark 2:* You should be using your work from Question 9!"
