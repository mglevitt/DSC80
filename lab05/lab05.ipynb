    "## Instructions\n",
    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding work will be developed in an accompanying `lab*.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labs and programming assignments will be graded in (at most) two ways:\n",
    "1. The functions and classes in the accompanying python file will be tested (a la DSC 20),\n",
    "2. The notebook will be graded (for graphs and free response questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not change the function names in the `*.py` file**\n",
    "- The functions in the `*.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. The dictionary at the end of the file (`GRADED FUNCTIONS`) contains the \"grading list\". The final function in the file allows your doctests to check that all the necessary functions exist.\n",
    "- If you changed something you weren't supposed to, just use git to revert!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for working in the Notebook**:\n",
    "- The notebooks serve to present you the questions and give you a place to present your results for later review.\n",
    "- The notebook on *lab assignments* are not graded (only the `.py` file).\n",
    "- Notebooks for PAs will serve as a final report for the assignment, and contain conclusions and answers to open ended questions that are graded.\n",
    "- The notebook serves as a nice environment for 'pre-development' and experimentation before designing your function in your `.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for developing in the .py file**:\n",
    "- Do not change the function names in the starter code; grading is done using these function names.\n",
    "- Do not change the docstrings in the functions. These are there to tell you if your work is on the right track!\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional functions to solve the lab! \n",
    "    - Developing in python usually consists of larger files, with many short functions.\n",
    "    - You may write your other functions in an additional `.py` file that you import in `lab**.py` (much like we do in the notebook).\n",
    "- Always document your code!"

To do this, transform the `father` column into a categorical column by binning the values of `father` into [quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile). Once this is done, you can impute the column as in lecture (and described above).\n",

Your function should return a __Series__ (Hint: `pd.qcut` may be helpful!).\n",

    "### Probabilistic imputation of quantitative columns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "In lecture, you learned how to impute a categorical column by sampling from the dataframe column. One problem with this technique is that the imputation will never generate imputed values that weren't already in the dataset. When the column under consideration is quantitative, this may not be a reasonable assumption. For example, `56.0`, `57.0`, and `57.5` are in the heights dataset, yet `56.5` is not. Thus, any imputation done by sampling from the dataset will not be able to generate a height of `56.5`, even though it's clearly a reasonable value to occur in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, you will impute the `child` column *unconditionally* from the distribution of `child` heights present in the dataset. This means that you will use the values present in `child` to impute missing values. i.e. values that appear in `child` more will probably appear more when imputing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach to imputing from a quantitative distribution, is as follows:\n",
    "* Find the empirical distribution of `child` heights by creating a histogram (using 10 bins) of `child` heights.\n",
    "* Use this histogram to generate a number within the observed range of `child` heights:\n",
    "    - The likelihood a generated number belongs to a given bin is the proportion of the bin in the histogram. (Hint: `np.histogram` is useful for this part).\n",
    "    - Any number within a fixed bin is equally likely to occur. (Hint: `np.random.choice` and `np.random.uniform` may be useful for this part).\n",
    "    \n",
    "Create a function `quantitative_distribution` that takes in a Series and an integer `N > 0`, and returns an array of `N` using the method described above. (For writing this function, and this function only, it is *ok* to use loops).\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function `impute_height_quant` that takes in a Series of `child` heights with missing values (aka `child_X`) and imputes them using the scheme above. **You should use `quantitative_distribution` to help you do this.**"
