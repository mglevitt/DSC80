    "## Instructions\n",
    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and markdown cells to display your answers to the problems. Unlike DSC 10, the notebook is *only* for displaying a readable version of your final answers. The coding work will be developed in an accompanying `lab*.py` file, that will be imported into the current notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labs and programming assignments will be graded in (at most) two ways:\n",
    "1. The functions and classes in the accompanying python file will be tested (a la DSC 20),\n",
    "2. The notebook will be graded (for graphs and free response questions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not change the function names in the `*.py` file**\n",
    "- The functions in the `*.py` file are how your assignment is graded, and they are graded by their name. The dictionary at the end of the file (`GRADED FUNCTIONS`) contains the \"grading list\". The final function in the file allows your doctests to check that all the necessary functions exist.\n",
    "- If you changed something you weren't supposed to, just use git to revert!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for working in the Notebook**:\n",
    "- The notebooks serve to present you the questions and give you a place to present your results for later review.\n",
    "- The notebook on *lab assignments* are not graded (only the `.py` file).\n",
    "- Notebooks for PAs will serve as a final report for the assignment, and contain conclusions and answers to open ended questions that are graded.\n",
    "- The notebook serves as a nice environment for 'pre-development' and experimentation before designing your function in your `.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for developing in the .py file**:\n",
    "- Do not change the function names in the starter code; grading is done using these function names.\n",
    "- Do not change the docstrings in the functions. These are there to tell you if your work is on the right track!\n",
    "- You are encouraged to write your own additional functions to solve the lab! \n",
    "    - Developing in python usually consists of larger files, with many short functions.\n",
    "    - You may write your other functions in an additional `.py` file that you import in `lab**.py` (much like we do in the notebook).\n",
    "- Always document your code!"

    "   - Characters after the second '\\\\$' can only have any number of the letters 'a', 'b', 'c' (upper or lower case), with every 'a' before every 'b', and every 'b' before every 'c'.\n",

    "The file in `data/messy.txt` contains personal information from a fictional website that a user scraped from webserver logs. Within this dataset, there are four fields that interest you:\n",
    "1. Email Addresses (assume they are alphanumeric user-names and domain-names),\n",
    "2. [Social Security Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number#Structure)\n",
    "3. Bitcoin Addresses (alpha-numeric strings of long length)\n",
    "4. Street Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function `extract_personal` that takes in a string like `open('data/messy.txt').read()` and returns a tuple of four separate lists containing values of the 4 pieces of information listed above (in the order given). Do **not** keep empty values.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint*: There are multiple \"delimiters\" in use in the file; there are few enough of them that you can safely determine what they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Since this data is messy/corrupted, your function will be allowed to miss ~5% of the records in each list. Good spot checking using certain useful substrings (e.g. `@` for emails) should help assure correctness! Your function will be tested on a sample of the file `messy.txt`."
